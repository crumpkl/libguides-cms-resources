# LibGuides CMS Resources

Mastering LibGuides CMS without any previous experience in LibGuides can be a tricky business. Below are some resources I used to build the Gregg-Graniteville Library's website (https://library.usca.edu/home).

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap v3 3.7 https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/

LibGuides is built on Bootstrap. Not the current version of Bootrap but the framework makes it much easier to customize the your library's website.
