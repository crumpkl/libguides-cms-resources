# LibGuides CMS Resources

Mastering LibGuides CMS without any previous experience in LibGuides can be a tricky business. Below are some resources I used to build the Gregg-Graniteville Library's website (https://library.usca.edu/home).

## Bootstrap

Bootstrap v3 3.7 https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/getting-started/

LibGuides is built on Bootstrap, both the front-end and back-end. Because the back-end is also build on Bootstrap we must use the same version or things will become tricky on the back-end (the layout will change and etc - speaking from experience). 
    
    Customization options
      
    -Navbar
    -Buttons
    -Dropdowns
    -Alerts
    -Layout
    -Etc
      
 For more customizaiton options see the "Components" section on the Bootstrap website (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/).
 
 
 ## Font Awesome
 
 Font Awesome v4.7 https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/
 
 Font Awesome is a great way to add icons to your website. LibGuides uses Font Awesome icons on the back-end side so to make sure not to upset the apple cart, we must use the same version or risk upsetting the apple cart (also speaking from experience, if you use the most recent version, the icons on the back-end will not load). 
 
 There are so many icons to choose from with Font Awesome. https://fontawesome.com/v4.7.0/icons/
